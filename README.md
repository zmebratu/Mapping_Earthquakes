# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
For this project, we collaborated with a non-profit organization that provides data-driven stories on natural disasters globally, specifically on earthquake maps with interactive features. These maps will be available on the US Geological Service website and mobile app.

We utilized JavaScript, D3, and the Leaflet library to gather the coordinates and magnitudes for plotting the data, while Mapbox was used for displaying the visualizations. Each earthquake on the map has a pop-up marker that shows its precise location and magnitude, and the circles representing each earthquake are colored and sized based on their magnitude.

## Main Objective
The primary goal of this project was to visually display the differences in earthquake magnitudes across the globe over a seven-day period using three layers:

Tectonic Plates
Earthquakes
Major Earthquakes.
